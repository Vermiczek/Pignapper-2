# Pignapper-2
My first semi-serious game I'm making to learn a bit more advanced C++. The game is going to be a dynamic survival platformer with very quick action (which requires good opitmization and precise code). WORK IN PROGRESS

Honestly all that's left is to implement texture and sounds which is just a few hours of work put I don't have the time. However now it's playable and IMO fun! As long as you manage to compile it. :) (you'll need to link SFML)
